# 🖼️ PixStar Digital Photo Frame Management
**Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Organizing and Syncing Photos from OneDrive**

This workflow ensures all photos for the Pix-Star frame are managed simply and consistently, primarily using a **Month_Year** structure.

---

## 1. 📂 OneDrive File Structure

All photo albums intended for the Pix-Star frame **MUST** be located within a single, dedicated directory in OneDrive.

### Root Directory

* **Name:** `PixStar_Photos/`

The Pix-Star frame is configured to link to the subdirectories within this root folder, creating individual Web Albums.

### Album Naming and Nesting

Use the `YYYY_MM_[Description]` format for easy sorting and reference.

```text
└── OneDrive/
    └── PixStar_Photos/
        ├── 2025_01_General/           <-- Default Monthly Folder (Bulk Photos)
        │   ├── IMG_001.JPG
        │   └── IMG_002.JPG
        ├── 2025_02_Smith_Wedding/     <-- Event-Specific Folder (Curated)
        │   ├── Ceremony_01.JPG
        │   └── Reception_01.JPG
        ├── 2025_03_General/
        │   └── Photo_from_Jane.PNG
        └── EVERGREEN_Landscapes_Scenery/
            └── Sunset_2025.JPG
```
Key Naming Conventions:

* **Default Albums:** Use YYYY_MM_General/ for bulk, chronological photos.

* **Event Albums:** Use YYYY_MM_[Event_Name]/ for curated collections.

* **Permanent Albums:** Use a clear identifier like EVERGREEN_[Topic]/ for photos that should always be in the rotation.

## 2. ✅ Pix-Star Best Practices

These tips ensure the best experience on the digital frame.

* **Connectivity:** Keep the frame connected to Wi-Fi for automatic syncs.

* **Album Size:** Divide photos into monthly or event-based albums. Avoid making extremely large albums for faster loading times.

* **Photo Quality:** Use standard resolution images. Ultra-high resolution photos may slow down the slideshow.

* **Auto-Sync:** Ensure auto-sync is enabled for all linked OneDrive albums so new photos appear automatically.

* **Maintenance:** Periodically review and prune older albums to keep the slideshow fresh.

* **Quick Share:** Use the frame’s unique email address for instant photo uploads from remote users.
